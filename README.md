# Hashtable
## About the project
This project implements a hash table using the chain method. In the first part of the project, a study of the effectiveness of several hash functions was conducted. In the second part, optimization was carried out using three methods: 1) AVX optimization; 2) assembler insertion; 3) replacement of some function with its own, which is written in assembler.

## Part 1 - hash-function research
### Always return 1
